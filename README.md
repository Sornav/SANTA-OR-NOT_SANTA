-----------------------------------------------------------------------XXXXXXXX-------------------------------------------------


This model classifies if the input image is Santa's photo or not,the dataset is available in the link given in the document named 'Dataset Link' which is present in this repository,first we used Transfer Learning Technique to train/fit and predict Santa's image on the pre-trained ImageNet VGG-19 Architecture.We got a very pretty good Accuracy of more than 96%,and our model gives very good predictions.

Thereafter,We built our own CNN model using Dense Layer and CONV2D Layers and again got a pretty good Accuracy of more than 97% and we saved our both the models.
